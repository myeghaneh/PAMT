First Persian (Farsi) Short Argumentative Text Coprus 


Argumentation mining (AM) is a multidisciplinary research practice that combines several fields of study such as computational
linguistics, machine learning (ML) and philosophy. It is concerned with extracting arguments from texts and classifying
the elements (e.g., conclusion and premise) and relations between them, as well as creating an argumentative structure. A
significant hurdle to research in this area for the Persian language is the lack of annotated Persian-language corpora. This paper
seeks to introduce the first argumentative corpus in Persian and the possibility of expanding argumentation mining using the
extension of the Persian-language version of the argumentative microtext corpus (AMT) based on the machine translation (MT)
and carefully post-editing of the AMT.
